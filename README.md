# lewis-signalling-game-nn
This is the GitHub repository where the code for my FA 2023 PHIL2001 project is stored. The repository contains `sankey.py`, _which is not to be touched under any circumstances_, as it it used to generate visualizations in `lewis_reinforcement.ipynb`, which is a Jupyter Notebook containing the source code for the `RLAgent` class, as well as functions for training and displaying the state of the agents. The code is not configured for use, but does contain simple docstrings so that someone sufficiently familiar with Python and the libraries used could run the program. 

Scattered around the `.ipynb` is the code used to create the visualizations for the paper, which can be found [on my website](https://elijahsandler.com/projects/simulating-lsg).
